#User Management

todos: 
 - adjust build tools -> need proper jshint jscs and testing that works correctly with promises.
 - complete error code lib. 
 - throw out odata module -> shouldn't be needed here.
 - docs
 - how will the end user specify whats the properties of the user? Maybe inject a json sec into it.
